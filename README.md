## Current Project
I am currently working on an AI-assisted learning platform for students. The primary application involves using chatbots powered by GPT to facilitate discussions between students, promoting their academic growth through conversation. The platform will be built on Discord, enabling students to converse with the Discord bot, and will also include a web UI for students and teachers to track learning progress.
